Note: I was really running short of time and tried  my best to meet your expectation. I'm getting married today(April 1st,2018)
I mean i'm getting married today, I have hardly spend 10-12 hours on this problem to solve. I wish i could get chance to
complete on the pending tasks that i left over. I'm really excited for this opputunity but i won't be able to do everything
at one time. So i have finished as much as i can. Looking forward from you to hear on the code that i committed. Your feedback
is really valuable. Please share your comments on my code even they are negative. Looking forward to hear from your folks.
Just wanna buy some time to do the bonus rounds and the pending tasks.
